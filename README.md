- 👋 Hi, I’m @Codyquitt
- 👀 I’m interested in front end development 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css, and javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that would help me build my portfolio and hopefully get my foot in the door at a tech company. I'm new to programming and would really like some pointers on what to focus on and hopefully learn some cool tricks.
